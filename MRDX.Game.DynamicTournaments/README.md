## Dynamic Tournament Progression for MR2DX

* Tournament Monsters (the opponents you fight against) are both randomly generated, and grow alongside you as months pass.
* Tournament Monsters will rank up, learn techniques, and maybe even pull some shenanigans you as a player only wish you could!
* Tournament Monster types are, by default, generally locked to similar breeds you have available.
* The mod includes a few optional gameplay tweaks to promote the use and engagement with tournaments.

### Latest Update
* v0.2.4
* Growth Rate Adjustments - New growth patterns have been added, along with strengthening the general growths across the board. Sorry all defense monsters! Monsters will grow the slightest bit faster, and have lower starting stats (resulting in more pronounced variances).
* Experimental Autosave Support - An optional configuration file option has been added that enables the mod to integrate with autosaves. Please review the configuration option.
* Lifespan Adjustments - Monsters will now live longer by default. 
* More Names - More Names for the Name God
* Week 1 Tournament Cycling Fix - No longer should tournaments be shuffled at the speed of sound for new save files.

### Important Information
This mod does not natively support integration with autosaves. You may keep the feature enabled, but loading an autosave will wipe your progress unless the Experimental Autosave Support is enabled!
