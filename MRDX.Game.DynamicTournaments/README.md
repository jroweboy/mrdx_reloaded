## Dynamic Tournament Progression for MR2DX

* Tournament Monsters (the opponents you fight against) are both randomly generated, and grow alongside you as months pass.
* Tournament Monsters will rank up, learn techniques, and maybe even pull some shenanigans you as a player only wish you could!
* Tournament Monster types are, by default, generally locked to similar breeds you have available.
* The mod includes a few optional gameplay tweaks to promote the use and engagement with tournaments.
